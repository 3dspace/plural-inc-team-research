A code-free repo for writers to explore what git is and what it does

Explaining Git, or Github, without the context of someone needing some code, is not easy.

This is a "readme" file. Every repo should have one. If I have fragments of chapters for my book in documents that are named and not numbered, I should explain what I'm doing here. Even if only so that I don't forget after a long summer of drinking heavily and ignoring my book.

Or if I've got a long line of things I wrote for some magazine, with all my notes and brainstorming sessions and hand-drawn diagrams carefully stashed with each article. Either way, the "readme" file is a place to say quickly, "here's what's going on in here".

This "readme" file just tries to explain what a "readme" file is, without mentioning any code.

And this "repo" is just a place where we can explore what Github does without even imagining touching any code.
